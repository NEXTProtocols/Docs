## Sending the YAML (`config_yaml_content`)

The YAML must be sent **as plain text**, inside `input.config_yaml_content`.
The server does **not** receive a real `.yaml` file. It receives a string.

### Example (JSON string with newlines)

```json
{
  "input": {
    "config_yaml_content": "model: Ostris-1-6b-fp8\n\nlearning_rate: 0.0001\n\nnum_train_steps: 1000\n"
  }
}
```

Important notes:
- YAML line breaks must be encoded as **`\n`** inside the JSON string.
- Keep YAML indentation using **spaces**. The simplest is **2 spaces**.
- Add a trailing `\n` if possible. Parsers are often more tolerant.

### Variant (if your client supports multi-line strings)

Some clients let you write a multi-line string and automatically handle escaping.

In all cases, **on the wire**, it must be a valid JSON string.

## Common mistakes (avoid these)

- **Sending YAML as a JSON object**: wrong. `config_yaml_content` must be a **string**.
- **Using TABs in YAML**: wrong. YAML is very sensitive to tabs.
- **Breaking indentation**: wrong. A single bad indent can invalidate the whole YAML.
- **Using `\r\n` (Windows) depending on tools**: if you see weird parsing errors, force `\n` only.
- **Unescaped JSON quotes**: if your YAML contains `"` you must escape it as `\"` inside the JSON string
  (or use a client that escapes automatically).
- **Dataset URL not reachable**: the URL must be reachable by the worker (usually public, over `https`).
- **Sending an empty YAML**: wrong. Send the full config expected by the training.

## Quick checklist before calling the API

- **Valid JSON**: the request body parses as JSON.
- **`config_yaml_content` is a string**: yes.
- **Valid YAML**: validate it with a local YAML parser if possible.
- **No tabs**: spaces only.
- **Zip URL**: downloadable from an external machine.
